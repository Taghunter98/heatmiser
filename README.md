# Heatmiser Recipe Automation

## Overview

This project is a self-hosted smart heating server designed to integrate with the **Heatmiser Neo** system. It automates heating schedules (**Recipes**), monitors temperature data, and optimises energy efficiency by running during lower electricity tariff periods.

Built using **Python**, this server was originally developed to help my parents automate their **air source heat pump**, reducing energy costs while maintaining comfort. By intelligently adjusting heating schedules based on real-time conditions, it provides a **cost-effective, hands-free smart heating solution**.

## Features

- **Automated Scheduling:** Adjusts heating schedules dynamically using real-time weather data.
- **Heatmiser Neo Integration:** Seamlessly communicates with Heatmiser thermostats via API.
- **Weather API Support:** Fetches external weather data to optimise heating efficiency.
- **Database Storage:** Logs temperature data for analysis and automation.
- **Robust Logging:** Detailed logs for debugging and monitoring.

## Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.9+**
- MySQL (for database storage)
- Heatmiser Neo API access
- A valid **Weather API** key
- A virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Taghunter98/heatmiser.git
   cd heatmiser
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up the database:**  
   Run the provided **database schema** on your MySQL database.

4. **Configure the `.env` file** with API keys, database credentials, and email settings:
   ```bash
   SECRET_KEY='coolSecretKey'
   HOST="192.168.4.65"
   USER="johnsmith"
   PASS="password123"
   DATABASE="Heatmiser"
   EMAIL_SENDER="coolemailprovider@gmail.com"
   EMAIL_PASSWORD="xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   EMAIL_RECEIVER="josh@gmail.com"
   SMTP_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
   SMTP_PORT=587
   ```
5. **Run the server with Gunicorn:**
   ```bash
   gunicorn -w 1 -b 0.0.0.0:6000 'app:create_app()'
   ```

---

### **(Optional) Setting up a Systemd Service (Linux)**

If deploying on a **Linux server**, you can configure **systemd** to run the service automatically on boot:

1. **Create a systemd service file:**
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/heatmiser.service
   ```
2. **Add the following configuration:**

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Heatmiser Smart Heating Server
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=<USER>
   Group=www-data
   WorkingDirectory=/home/<USER>/heatmiser/heatmiser
   Environment="PATH=/home/<USER>/heatmiser/htmsr/bin"
   Environment="VIRTUAL_ENV=/home/<USER>/heatmiser/htmsr"
   ExecStart=/home/<USER>/heatmiser/htmsr/bin/gunicorn -w 1 -b 0.0.0.0:6000 --access-logfile /home/<USER>/heatmiser/logs/heatmiser_access.log

   # Logging
   StandardOutput=append:/home/<USER>/heatmiser/logs/heatmiser_stdout.log
   StandardError=append:/home/<USER>/heatmiser/logs/heatmiser_error.log

   SyslogIdentifier=heatmiser

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. **Save and exit**, then reload **systemd**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
4. **Enable the service to start on boot:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable heatmiser.service
   ```
5. **Start the service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start heatmiser.service
   ```
6. **Check the service status:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status heatmiser.service
   ```

## Background

Managing home heating efficiently can be challenging, especially with fluctuating **energy costs** and **variable weather conditions**.

The **Heatmiser Neo** system offers built-in automation via "Recipes," allowing users to schedule heating across different rooms and times. However, manually configuring these schedules can be **time-consuming** and **cost-inefficient**â€”especially when energy tariffs are lower at night.

This project **enhances automation** by integrating:

- **Real-time weather data**
- **Dynamic tariff-aware adjustments**

Using the **Heatmiser API**, this system automatically **activates Recipes** based on external conditions, making home heating **smarter, more efficient, and cost-effective**.

## Heatmiser Neo Integration

This server interacts with the **Heatmiser API** to:

- Retrieve the current thermostat status.
- Adjust temperature settings dynamically.
- Automate scheduling based on real-time external factors.

## How It Works

1. The system fetches **weather forecasts** from an external API.
2. It calculates the **optimal heating schedule** based on predefined logic.
3. The server **sends API commands** to Heatmiser Neo thermostats.
4. Temperature data is **logged and analysed** for efficiency improvements.

## Planned Features (v1.1+)

- **Web Dashboard:** A front-end interface for monitoring and controlling schedules.
- **Clone Recipes & Profiles:** Adds missing functionality from the **Heatmiser Neo** app.
